## Analysis 
### Summary Analysis
We obtained student count, school budget, test scores for reading and math from 15 schools in a district.
Out of 39,170 students, I found a avarage passing math score of 78.99, a average reading score of 81.88.  The overall passing student was 65.17%. 

- I noticed that charter schools out perform district schools in both overall reading and math scores for each grade. 
- I also noticed that the school budget and per student spending does not neccesarily correlate to higher scores.
